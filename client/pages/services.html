					<h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">LazyGalaxy follows a disciplined software development process that iteratively applies three phases: Planning, Building and Deployment. The philosophy is to work on smaller manageable targets that will be delivered in the short term, rather than setting long term targets that complicate deliveries and expectations.</h3>

					<h4 class="service-heading">Planning</h4>
					<p class="text-muted">Thorough planning takes place with clients by identifying what can realistically be delivered in the short term, always keeping in mind long term goals. Planned deliverables are chosen based on client value and ideally will never exceed a one month time window for delivery.</p>

This is the phase that involves clients in the development process by constantly providing feedback that aligns a project with the client vision.</p>
